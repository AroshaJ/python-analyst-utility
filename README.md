## Quick Start

Here are a few examples to help you get started:

### Example 1: Loading and Cleaning a CSV File

```python
from python_analyst_utils.csv_management.csv_helper import CsvSourceHelper
from python_analyst_utils.pandas_management.pandas_transformation_helper import PandasTransformationHelper
import pandas as pd

# Initialize helpers
csv_helper = CsvSourceHelper()
transformation_helper = PandasTransformationHelper()

# Load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
file_path = "data/sample.csv"
data = csv_helper.get_dataframe_from_csv(file_path)

# Clean the data: trim whitespace and handle NaNs
data = transformation_helper.trim_values_in_columns(data, ["Name", "Address"])
data = transformation_helper.replace_nas_with_zeros(data, "Salary")

# Print cleaned data
print(data.head())
```

### Example 2: Managing Files and Directories

```python
from python_analyst_utils.file_management.file_storage_manager import FileStorageManager

# Initialize the file manager
manager = FileStorageManager()

# Create a folder and check if it exists
folder_path = "data/new_folder"
manager.create_folder_if_doesnt_exist(folder_path)
folder_exists = manager.does_folder_exist(folder_path)
print(f"Folder exists: {folder_exists}")
```
