## Quick Start Examples

#### Example 1: Working with Excel Files

```python
from python_analyst_utils.excel_management.excel_manager import ExcelSourceHelper

# Initialize the helper and open an Excel file
helper = ExcelSourceHelper()
data = helper.get_excel_data_as_dataframe("path/to/file.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
print(data)
```

#### Example 2: Cleaning Data with Pandas Helper

```python
from python_analyst_utils.pandas_management.pandas_transformation_helper import PandasTransformationHelper
import pandas as pd

# Initialize the helper
helper = PandasTransformationHelper()

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({"Name": [" Alice ", "Bob"], "Age": [30, None]})

# Clean the data
df_cleaned = helper.trim_values_in_columns(df, ["Name"])
df_cleaned = helper.replace_nas_with_zeros(df_cleaned, "Age")
print(df_cleaned)
```

#### Example 3: File Management

```python
from python_analyst_utils.file_management.file_storage_manager import FileStorageManager

# Initialize the manager and create a folder
manager = FileStorageManager()
manager.create_folder_if_doesnt_exist("path/to/new/folder")
```

#### Example 4: Detecting Date Formats

```python
from python_analyst_utils.date_format.date_detector import DateFormatDetector

# Detect format for a single date string
format_detected = DateFormatDetector.detect_format("2023-12-25")
print(f"Detected format: {format_detected}")
```
